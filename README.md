This project to to provide an example of the type of data dashboards I am able to create to aid business decision making and comes in two sections. The first section is a jupyter notebook that cleans and transforms the raw csv files and pickles them. This is then loaded into the main app file and used for a dash dashboard webapp. The sections were seperated to keep the processing time down when visiting the web app.
                                                                  
All data used is simulated and was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data. It was chosen as it was very similar to the data I am used to, reports exported from Sage accounting software into Microsoft Excel and was therefore thought to be representative of real issues.
